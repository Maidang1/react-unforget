# Forgetti

[Forgetti](https://github.com/lxsmnsyc/forgetti) is also another alternative tool made to optimize React components at build time to make it run faster at runtime. But, when it comes to more complicated patterns, it generates failing code. For example, loops and mutations can lead to generating code that does not work.
